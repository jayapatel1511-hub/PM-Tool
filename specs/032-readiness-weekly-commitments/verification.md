# Verification: Ready-to-Start Planning and Weekly Commitments

**Date**: 2026-09-26
**State**: Domain rule increment only. No migration, API, UI, browser, deployment or pilot execution performed for this packet.

Documentation validation is recorded in `docs/coordination-spec-validation.md`. Product acceptance scenarios AC-RDY-01, AC-RDY-02, AC-RDY-03, AC-RDY-04, AC-RDY-05 are **not run end to end**. Implementation tasks remain unchecked until their full scope is complete.

## Domain rules increment

`src/Hub.Domain/Readiness.cs` now defines canonical readiness checks and derived states, including explicit unknown applicability, a narrowly scoped live assumption permission, and the rule that review/submission gates cannot be overridden by that permission. It also defines performer-only commitment and immutable-snapshot denominator rules. The focused `ReadinessTests` domain suite passed 3/3 locally after recompilation, covering a submitted handoff, unknown applicability, expiry and changed-basis reassessment, nonwaivable review gate, performer signature and a withdrawn promise retained in the original denominator. These are pure rules only: no migration, API, UI, browser or acceptance scenario has yet run. Packet 032 remains **UNPROVEN** for product acceptance.
